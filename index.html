    <h3>Who's Orange?</h3>
    <p>He's a 3-years-old orange tabby my girlfriend force me to adopt.
      He joined our family in June 2021.</p>
    <p>She and her family calls him 'boy'. A rather bland and immemorable name, to be honest.
      Because the name lacks something that sticks on your head, i started calling him 'boi',
      like edgy 7-yr old memelord in reddit giving reactions to deepfried obscure memes. Beacuse
      thats not <em>sticky</em> enough, i started to call him 'M(b)oi' with a high-pitched sound.
      Somehow, he responds nicely to that name and so that's his name.</p>
    <p>After i relocate him to mother's house, my family calls him 'oyen', a childlish way to say 'oren'
      or 'orange' in our language - it literally means 'orange'. <em>Orange the orange</em>. My brother and i
      love calling him orange just because it sounds funny, especially when we said it using dutch accent
      (<em>oranje</em>) so there's that.</p>

    <h3>Why is he Fat?</h3>
    <p> He used to be slim and young and dumb and active and keep wanting to go outside and not going
      back even if he got into fights and lose.
      Once he went out and not coming back for a while. My gf got super sad and
      i got super confused. I spent few laps around the hood to look for him.
      Turns out he got kidnapped by the neighbor. I took him back and got him grounded.</p>
    <p>I took him to my mother's house to keep an eye on him more easily. Since he keep
      getting out every now and then, and going to the neighbors' rooftops without being
      able to get down, mother decided to get him neutered. And so he's now ball-less.</p>
    <p>Since he got no balls now, he usually spend his time inside, sleeping and eating and
      pissing and taking crap all over the kitchen. Not mentioning snatching pieces of
      fried chicken every now and then. And so, now he's gotten fat. </p>

              <li>Less carefully processed fried catfish. What a canibal.</li>
              <li>Freshly-taken-out-of-container dry bulk cat food that i got from the petshop for like 50k per 2kg. I think
                they're raising the price even more.</li>
              <li>Pieces of fried chicken which he will gnaw upon after sniffing it for 2-3 minutes to make sure that it is,
                in fact, a chicken. Not rarely the piece of chicken got snatched by his hungry hungry brothers.</li>

              rush and sit next to your feet whenever you stand in front of the fridge. I've set the portion to 1/3 sachet
              a day for moderation, but my dear mother know no limits, and could give him 1+ sachet <strong>a day.</strong> He'll
              then throw up on the couch from too much treats. </li>
              <li>Pieces of chicken that he snag every now and then from the pantry. He never show that much attention to
              chicken on the times when we deliberately feed him. The bastard.</li>
              <li>He kinda love tempe. Especially if it's marinated with salty chicken stock. With pieces of the chicken.</li>
