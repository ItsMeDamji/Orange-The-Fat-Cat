    <h2>I hate this stinky furball. And he knows it well.</h2>
    <p>Thus he always tried to infuriate us every damn time.</p>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <br>
    Some of his antics may include, but not limited, to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Going out and not wanting to go back</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Slipped out of my watch and went outside for a stroll and grass sniffing around the block, ended getting kidnapped by the neighbor's daughters.
          Shithead decided to keep him eventhough he got lace around his neck. Almost got into arguments
          at 23.30 just because the fatass. </li>
        <li>Went out by accident because mother forgot to close the door and he was able to thin himself
          under the gates at 20.00, found on the neighbors' roof staring at us mockingly while enjoying himself
          up there not being able (or not wanting) to go down. A hoist of Ladder and a stick of his favourite treat later
          we're able to get his dumbass down </li>
        <li>Went out <em>again</em> one night and spend somewhere like 2 weeks at yet-to-be-known neighbors
          (not the first neighbor, mind you) to the point where their daughters acclaimed that the fatass is theirs.
          He got out and while i tried to fetch him, a horde of kids scrambled around trying to catch him as well.
          Since i'm not really that good with kids (especially at that time, i'm kinda medium built and dressed in tac-black.
          Pretty much like kidnapper from 70s movies) - and i'll be honest, i hate kids - my girlfriend needs to do the tallking
          until we got the dumbass back. </li>
          <li><strong>In fact,</strong> i've been keeping up with his antics for quite some time, i know that his routine whenever he wants some fresh air
            and decided to go out for a stroll unknown to us would be something that required me to do:
            <ol>
              <li>Look outside and then left, if he just went out he might still be around and never going right. Well, only sometimes. He love going for dusty patches on
              the ground or to take a crap in a fresh sand used to build houses.</li>
              <li>If still no sign of him, try looking at the one particular neighbor house that he love visiting so much. Apparently he found himself a crush before we cut
              his balls. Well, maybe the feelings are still there.</li>
              <li>Still havent found him, look for rooftops around the houses. See if you can find his mocking face staring at you snarkily.</li>
              <li>If that still did not work, maybe walk around the neighborhood shaking a can of his dry food while having his favourite treat your other hand.
              It's something he can't resist</li>
              <li>If you can't still find him, it might be a good time to think about things to say to your girlfriend and how it's partly her fault for bringing him to your
              house because you've told her you don't want another cat and how you've had your best moments with cats already with two cats that keep yourself company back on
              july of 2020 when you're all home alone for months to escape from a bad family problem and its one of the first time you're actually feeling pretty good to be alive,
              only to forced to move back with your mother in a new smaller home and get those two lovely cat died because of some strange flu several months later and keep hating
              yourself because you brought them to the new home.
              <br>
              <br>
              What were we talking?
              <br>
              <br>
              Oh yeah, he will usually show up sooner or later with that smug innocent look on his orange face.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Bathroom related incident</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>I was happy and proud of him when he first came to mother's house and he successfully litter in the bathroom.
          even if its not directly unto the toilet, it makes it easier to clean and maybe we won't need to spend money on toilet sand anymore.
          I know that he's a smart tabby. Sadly, i know he's sly as well. A week later he started to take dumps directly behind the bathroom door,
          resulting anyone that open the slightly closed door to smear cat feces all over the door floor. Apparently he does this - and not littering
          in the toilet just because <em>he loves drinking from it</em>. Filthy bastard. </li>
        <li>Talking about drinking from the toilet, one of his behavior regarding drinking is that he always prefer drinking from a huge container, be it
          a bucket for doing the dishes or mopping the floor, a wash basin that mom forgot to put upside down, or bathing water basin that's way taller than he is.
          Apparently, anything except the cute water bowl that i bought just for him for like $1. He doesn't care, he prefer even the mossy water scoop rather than the bowl.</li>
        <li>Sadly him being smart and kindfully using the bathroom for littering was short-lived. Ever since seeing his step-brother (or uncle? He's a fat white alleycat named
          Billy, its another story) littering on the bathroom doormat, he found it as a more amusing and more efficient way to irritate us, and so he's been doing that
          for quite a while, forcing mother to clean his crap, the mat, and the floor everytime it happened. And while Billy is smart and kind enough to do that only if there's
          nobody to open the door for him to go outside and litter, orange always do it no matter the time and place, eventhough he was able to do it in the bathroom just like
          he used to do. And since he's smart and creative, he eventually figured out that bathroom is not the only place that has a doormat placed. So he will take a crap
          on the bathroom mat, and take a leak on the kitchen mat, forcing mother to clean both location after he ran away satisfied with the crime. What can i say, he's smart,
          just not that kind. Heck, he's an asshole; a true cat to it's owner. </li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><strong>Sleeping goofyness</strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Was in the middle of playing in a box when he decided to feel sleppy and fell asleep while wrestling the box.</li>
        <li> Once he slept in such a perfect spherical position i thought his butt was his head, and only shown the opposite when he moved because i pat his head-like butt.</li>
        <li> He love sleeping in the middle of the way just to spite anyone that tripped over him. He used to have a favourite sleeping spot below a chair we used to
          place our water dispenser. That is until Willy knew about it and decided to be curious and sniffed it every now and then. And so he moved. I think it's also because
          i like to yank him from his sleep from no apparent reason aside from i want to bury my face on his fat belly.</li>
      </ul></li>
